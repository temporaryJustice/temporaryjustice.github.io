## CPTS

I want to make this short and sweet. 

### The path

The path teaches great content, although, sometimes I found that questions in the labs were malformulated... Also, some modules can be reallyyyyy long to complete, which played a lot on my motivations. Anyways, you will have all the necessary content to go through the practical exam and I don't find the material too hard to understand.

### Preparation

I recommend getting used with tools for pivoting such as Ligolo. Why? Well, because metasploit kept crashing for some reasons for me... 
A great way for testing this is with pro labs. 

Also, make sure to get a ton of practical experience, covering all the modules you have done, because when you are going to get on the exam lab, you won't have the time to just look everything up. You need to have confidence in your skills. 

The attacking enterprise network is a great module, make sure to do it at least twice!

### The exam

The exam is 10 days long. I have personaly failed my first attempt. Good thing, we have two. Although I have completed the whole lab, I have done one big mistake: bad note taking.
By taking notes, I mean writing on your report what you do and what you found. DO NOT TRY TO RUSH EVERYTHING AND FORGET TO TAKE NOTES!!!!

Okay so the report is the most important thing of the whole exam and the hardest IMO... (I have submitted a 99 pages report and failed, so don't be an idiot like me).

Here is a list of what I wish I knew:

* Use sysreptor, you can either host it locally or create an account on cloud.
* Make sure to make a separate finding for each. Don't make a chain of findings (this will be in the compromise walkthrough, not the findings).
* Compare to the sample that is provided!!!! Make sure the syntax, the format and everything is the same!!!
* Take your command and its output! Also, take screenshots when it is needed (ex: you have a valid login on a website, well prove it!).
* Don't rush it... You will fail if you do.

### Difficulty
I do not think the exam is super hard. The hard part is actually not going over stuff too quickly. Make sure to enumerate well. If one method doesn't provide you what you were looking for, try another! This is why getting comfortable with the tools and the different vulnerabilites is important! Also, try stuff! If you find a "possible path" but don't see the value in doing this, well you might aswell try it! (If you have no options left of course)...

### Closing thoughts

Anyways, this was a big challenge for me, as it was the first time I ever wrote a pentesting report. The lab itself was pretty stable and quick. I didnt't find the lab very hard, but this is subdjective and I can not compare it to any other certifications. Anyways, this was definetly a challenge!
