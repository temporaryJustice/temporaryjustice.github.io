# Whoami

Hello everyone, welcome to my blog. I have no idea who is going to read this, but that's the point of a blog right? Anyways, I'm a security researcher who likes everything related to logic. Yes, I do like math... I like low level programming like ASM and C! I am fascinated by logical bugs. I like watchtowr labs ;). I'm pretty young (I guess). 19 years old. I have experience in malware development, pentesting and web security. Finally, I am looking forward into the exploit development field, as it combines all of my interests!

## My experience

- CPTS (Certified Penetration Tester Specialist)
- CTFs
- Little bit of bug bounty hunting
- About a year and a half of work in IT as a researcher and helpdesk

#### What now?

Well... Now that I have finished CPTS, I think I have the basics (and a little more) of the concept of hacking a computer. Although, I use exploits and don't create them. So, from now on, my ultimate goal is to learn exploit development. I am currently reviewing my C knowledge and plan on learning more assembly. Afterwards, I will start learning basic concepts of exploitation and debugging with ret2war games. I've always been thinking "Yeah I should focus on exploiting windows, since it's the most used OS, right?"... Right? 

Well, I changed my mind. Why? Because products like Forti, citrix, Ivanti, Sonicwall, etc... dont run on Windows. At least, the servers... Anyways, enough talking, I will be documenting my learning in this blog and doing some reviews of the websites I learn on, etc...

Ultimately, I want to be able to make my own lab and reproduce CVEs from scratch.
